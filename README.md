# RSVP React App

This is React based app that I built to play around with React and understand it better. Keep track of RSVPs by adding people and filtering through those who have responded and those who still have to respond. 

## Getting Started

This project uses "React Create App". Type npm run build to install the required dependencies. Then type npm start to deploy the app on a development server.

### Prerequisites

npm >= 5.0
